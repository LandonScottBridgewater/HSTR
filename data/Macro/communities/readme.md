Hawaiian CDPs (Census-Designated Places) are unincorporated communities or population centers defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes in Hawaii. Hawaiian CDPs function like "neighborhoods" or "communities" in data analysis, but without local government powers. They are essential for understanding local demographics and economic conditions across Hawaii's islands.

Hawaii’s total population: ~1.46 million.

Nearly 100% of residents live within either:
1. An incorporated place (Honolulu)
2. A Census-Designated Place (CDP)

This dataset covers all of these two.

In urban CDPs (like Hilo, Kailua-Kona, or Waikīkī), it's common to see:

30-70% price variation within the same CDP.
For example, oceanfront homes or properties with scenic views can cost double or triple compared to inland or older neighborhoods.

In rural or smaller CDPs, variability might be 20-50%, but it depends on:
Lot size
Condition of the property
Proximity to the coast or key infrastructure
