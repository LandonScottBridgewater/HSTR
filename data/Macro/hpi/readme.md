FHFA publishes the House Price Index (HPI) by metro areas and census tracts.

Census tract data can be spatially linked to CDPs for approximate trends.

Data goes back several decades, updated quarterly.

HPI measures house price changes, not absolute values â€” the quality and mix of houses can affect estimates.

HPI = Volatility 

t = time 
a = HPI Index at t
b = baseline price

estimated price = (a/100)*b
